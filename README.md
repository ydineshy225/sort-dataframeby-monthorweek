# Example1
In this example we will see how to sort a sample dataframe by month name column
``` python
    import pandas as pd
    
    df = pd.DataFrame([['Feb',254],['Apr',420],['Jan',301],['Mar',449]],columns=['Month','Sales'])
    df
    Out: 
      Month  Sales

    1   Apr    420
    2   Jan    301
    3   Mar    449
```
Now, use Sort_Dataframeby_Month function to sort above dataframe
``` python
    df_sort = sort_dataframeby_monthorweek.Sort_Dataframeby_Month(df=df,monthcolumnname='Month')
    df_sort
    Out:
      Month  Sales
    0   Jan    301
    1   Feb    254
    2   Mar    449
    3   Apr    420
```

# Example2
In this example we will see how to sort a sample dataframe by weekday column

``` python
    df1 = pd.DataFrame([['Tue',25],['Thu',42],['Mon',30],['Wed',44]],columns=['Weekday','Sales'])
    df1
    Out: 
      Weekday  Sales
    0     Tue     25
    1     Thu     42
    2     Mon     30
    3     Wed     44
```
Now, use Sort_Dataframeby_Weekday function to sort df1

``` python
    df1_sort = sort_dataframeby_monthorweek.Sort_Dataframeby_Weekday(df=df1,Weekdaycolumnname='Weekday')
    df1_sort
    Out: 
      Weekday  Sales
    0     Mon     30
    1     Tue     25
    2     Wed     44
